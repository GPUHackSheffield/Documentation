The Bede Facility
=================

Bede is a new EPSRC-funded Tier 2 (regional) HPC cluster. It is currently being configured and tested and one of its first uses will be to support the hackathon. 

This system is particularly well suited to supporting:

* Jobs that require multiple GPUs and possibly multiple nodes
* Jobs that require much movement of data between CPU and GPU memory

NB the system was previously known as NICE-19.
