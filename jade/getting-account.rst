Getting an account
==================


If not already registered, you need to sign up with the Hartree Centre  `SAFE system <https://um.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/hartree/signup.jsp>`_ providing an Institutional email address, which will be used as the SAFE login ID.

Note: emails such as gmail or hotmail will not be accepted

At this stage, in order to access the machine, you also need to enter an SSH key. Instructions on how to create this key and add it to your account details are at:
`SAFE User Guide <http://community.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/wiki/site/admin/Safe%20User%20Guide@8.html>`_ 

An email will be sent to you containing a password for SAFE which needs to be changed on first logging in. Once you have signed up, log on to SAFE and click on ‘Request Join Project’. From the dropdown list choose JAD044 and enter the Project signup password which, for this Project, is jadetraining44, and click ‘Request’.

Accounts on the system for your project will then be created for you, please refer to the official documentation on how to use the system.

If you encounter any problems do let me know. Alternatively, raise an issue on `GitHub <https://github.com/jade-hpc-gpu/jade-hpc-gpu.github.io/issues>`_ or contact one of the hackathon organisers.
